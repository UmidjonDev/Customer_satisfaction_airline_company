**Author : Umidjon Sattorov machine learning engineer, successfull graduator of course of SkillBox platform and student at Mohirdev platform**

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction for an airline service company using advanced machine learning techniques. After extensive training and evaluation of various algorithms, the final model achieved an impressive ROC AUC score of 0.99, demonstrating exceptional predictive performance.

**Features**

High Accuracy: Achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.99, indicating outstanding model performance.
Multiple Algorithms: Evaluated numerous machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
Customer Satisfaction: Predicts whether a customer is satisfied with the airline service based on various features.
Comprehensive Analysis: Includes detailed analysis and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and model robustness.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Core programming language for data processing and model development.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
FastAPI: Framework for creating APIs to deploy the model.

**Results**

The modelâ€™s high ROC AUC score of 0.99 highlights its ability to accurately predict customer satisfaction, making it a valuable tool for improving airline services.
Model which is used in this project is CatBoost Classifier. Here some metrics achieved while training the model.
